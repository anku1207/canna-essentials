                                    <p>CannaEssentials endeavours to ensure that every transaction on our website is seamless and without any hassle. We take great care in delivering our products and adhere to the highest quality standards. As a policy, we do not offer returns or exchanges on products which are delivered in perfect condition as per the order placed. If you’ve had an incorrect product delivered to you (product doesn’t match the item in the order confirmation), or if the product you receive has a genuine quality/manufacturing defect then we will be happy to exchange your product for a replacement. All items can be exchanged within 3 days upon delivery of products. Items exchanged for the first time will be free of cost, upon any subsequent exchange the charges borne will be levied on the customer. If you’ve received a defective product, send us pictures of the damaged item within the span of 48 hours and upon the same product or an alternative product of your choice failing to be in stock, we will be happy to, following a quality check, offer you a refund which will be processed in 14 working days (after the product reaches us). The refund shall be made through online mode. Orders once placed, cannot be cancelled.</p>
                                    <p>To return or exchange a product or report any damages in transit please get in touch with our customer care within 48 hours of delivery at 0120 4217538 from Monday to Saturday, between 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM (IST) or email us at support@cannaessentials.in with your order number, date of transaction, delivery address and an image of the wrongfully delivered or defective item. Our customer care team will look into the issue and respond to you within 72 working hours. We typically make a reverse pick-up within 3-4 working days. Given the nature of our products, we reserve sole discretion to provide resolution as we deem fit. Every return or exchange request is treated as an individual case. We are unable to offer refunds if we’ve been given an incorrect or incomplete shipping address, or if there are three failed delivery attempts by our shipping agency and/or the package is refused by the recipient.</p>
									<p>International Orders: if a customer refuses to pay the Duty as mandated by the respective country of shipment and doesn’t collect the order from our Shipping agency, Bombay Hemp Company will not be liable to provide a refund.</p>
